## Problem 4

Three natural numbers, 𝑝 \< 𝑗 \< 𝑦, that satisy 𝑦^2 = 𝑝2 + 𝑗2, are
forming “SuperBox”. “SuperBox” can be formed by different numbers 𝑝, 𝑗,
and 𝑦. However, there exist only one “SuperBox” that satisfies the
following condition (1):

𝑝 + 𝑗 + 𝑦 = 1000

Write an R code:  
a) to detect p, j and y, that satisfy condition (1);  
b) to calculate 𝑝 ∗ 𝑗 ∗ 𝑦 based on the results from (a);

``` r
# create matrix with dimensions
# equal to the maximum value of p and j
m <- matrix(nrow = 1000, ncol = 1000)

# loop through rows and columns,
# ie. each element in the matrix
for (p in 1:nrow(m)) {
  for (j in 1:ncol(m)) {
    # each element in the matrix represents a y value
    # use formula for calculating possible y values
    # based on row and col indeces, i.e. p/j values
    m[p, j] <- sqrt(p^2 + j^2)
    
    # if condition is met, print values for p, j & y
    # and p * j * y
    if (p + j + m[p, j] == 1000 & p < j) {
      print(paste0('p: ', p, ' j: ', j, ' y: ', m[p, j]))
      print(paste0('p * j * y = ', p * j * m[p, j]))
      # stop loop because we have our values already
      break
    }
  }
}
```

## Problem 5

Consider the following pseudo-code “Order”. For any vector of numbers 𝐴,
the given pseudo-code gives an updated vector with all numbers (from the
original 𝐴) in non-decreasing order.

<pre>
Algorithm "Order":
1 for t <- 2 to length[A]
2   do key <- A[t]
3       n <- t - 1
4       while n > 0 and A[n] > key
5           do A[n + 1] <- A[n]
6               n <- n - 1
7       A[n + 1] <- key
</pre>

  - Modify algorithm “Order” to write an R function that will return an
    updated vector with all numbers (from the original 𝐴) in the
    non-increasing order.
  - Apply your code to the following vector of numbers: `5.4,
    -1, 4, 6.3, 1, 2.1, 1`

Notes:

  - Pseudo-code presented above is adapted for R and uses 1-based
    indexing. Indexes in your R code should not be modified, i.e. they
    stay the same as indexes in the pseudo-code.
  - For example, 𝐴\[𝑛 + 1\] (see line 5) stays to be 𝐴\[𝑛 + 1\] and does
    not require “𝑛 + 1” to be modified/shifted in your R code.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
A <- c(5.4, -1, 4, 6.3, 1, 2.1, 1)

sort2 <- function(x) {
  # Loop through vector of numbers,
  # starting at the second element,
  for (t in 2:length(x)) {
    # which is our key. The key is used in
    # comparison to its previous number.
    key <- x[t]
    # n is the index of the previous number
    n <- t - 1
    # while the key is smaller than the previous number
    while (x[n] > key) {
      # store the key in a temporary variable
      temp <- x[n + 1]
      
      # switch the key and the previous number
      x[n + 1] <- x[n]
      x[n] <- temp
      
      # update index so that we are looping backwards in the vector
      # avoid going all the way to n = 0 by forcing 1 as the lowest value
      n <- max(1, n - 1)
      # update the key corresponding to the index n, so that
      # the key is the number following the number with index n
      key <- x[n + 1]
    }
  }
  # return updated vector
  return(x)
}

sort2(A)
```

## Problem 6

Consider the network G that consists of seven companies connected to
each other in the following way (Figure 2).

1.  Based on Figure 2, each company v has a number of its direct links
    (in the network G) denoted by degG(v). For example: degG(v3) = 3,
    because company v3 has three direct links (specifically, to
    companies v2, v4 and v5)
2.  List of compaies (i.e., neighbors) that are reachable from the
    company v in at most one hop (i.e., via direct link) within network
    G NG(𝐯). Each company u from NG(𝐯) has a number of its direct links
    (in the network G) denoted by degG(u).

Note: direct link is the link that directly connects two companies. For
example: v5 and v6 are connected via direct link; v4 and v3 are
connected via direct link, and so on.

3.  Network G (from Figure 2) can be presented as an edge list. The
    given edge list is presented in the .csv format. Please, find the
    attached “Connections.csv”-file.

For each company, we can measure its value of power Power(v) based on
the following algorithm (pseudo-code):

<pre>
Algorithm “Power”:
1   FOR each company v from G do:
2       Power(v) = 1 / 1 + deg_G(v)
3       FOR each company u from N_G(v) do:
4           Power(v) += 1 / 1 + deg_G(u)
5       END
6   END
7   print: for each company v its Power(v)
8   print: sigma Power(v), which is a sum of all Power(v)-s in G
</pre>

### Tasks

1.  You code should read the edge list from the CSV file
    “Connections.csv” into R, and create a graph (i.e., network) based
    on the “Connections.csv”. In your code, the created graph should be
    stored in the variable called g. To create a graph, you should use R
    package called igraph: <http://igraph.org/r/>
2.  Your code should find communities of companies in the created graph
    using a function called cluster\_louvain():
    <http://igraph.org/r/doc/cluster_louvain.html> Note: Function
    cluster\_louvain() is integrated into the igraph-package. This means
    that you should not create a mechanism to find a community
    structure. To find a community structure you just need to employ the
    given developed cluster\_louvain() function.
3.  Based on the results from the task 2 (in “III. TASKS”), your code
    should calculate the power of all companies (i.e., Power(v)) in each
    community based on the Algorithm “Power” introduced in “II.
    ALGORITHM”

<!-- end list -->

  - When your code calculates the power of companies, each community
    should be considered separately (as an independent network). It
    means that for each community, only internal companies and links
    (within a community) should be taken into account (i.e., internal
    community structure should be analyzed).

For example, in Figure 3 we have two detected communities: \*
Community\_1 consists of companies 1, 2, 3, and 4 and links 1-2, 1-3, 2-
3, and 3-4. Thus, the power of each company (i.e., Power(v)) should be
calculated based only on the given structure of the Community\_1. \*
Community\_2 consists of companies 5, 6, and 7 and links 5-6, 5-7, and
6-7. Thus, the power of each company (i.e., Power(v)) should be
calculated based only on the given structure of the Community\_2.

4.  Based on the lines 7-8 of the Algorithm “Power”, your code should
    display the following results (in the RStudio console):

<!-- end list -->

  - Power(v) of each company in the community
  - Sum of the Power-values of all companies in the community:
  - Results should be displayed in a similar format (in the
    RStudio-console):

<!-- end list -->

5.  You code should export results for each detected community to a
    separate CSV file:

<!-- end list -->

  - Each CSV file should contain the following information: \*\*
    Company\_ID: company that is a member of the current community \*\*
    Power: corresponding Power(v)-value

### Requirements

1.  igraph is the only package that should be called (loaded) in your R
    script: library(igraph). No other packages are allowed to be used.
2.  You must use functions induced\_subgraph() and degree() from the
    igraph- package in your R code.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
library(igraph)

# read csv file with edge list, store as a dataframe
connections <- read.csv("Connections.csv", header = FALSE)
# create graph from dataframe, stored as an igraph object
g <- graph.data.frame(connections, directed = FALSE)

# cluster the graph into communities
communities <- cluster_louvain(g)

# define function that takes a subgraph (community) as input,
# to be run for each community in a loop
calculate.power <- function(community) {
  # loop through all companies in the comunity
  # where V is used to create a vertex sequence containing
  # all vertices of the subgraph (community)
  for (company in V(community)) {
    # calculate the company's power based on number of direct links
    power <- 1 / (1 + degree(community, v = company))
    
    # loop through a company's direct links (neighbors)
    # add the power of the neighbor to the power variable define above
    for (neighbor in neighbors(community, company)) {
      power <- power + (1 / (1 + degree(community, v = neighbor)))
    }
    # when power is calculated for each company,
    # set its power as an attribute
    community <- set.vertex.attribute(community, "power", company, power)
  }
  
  # preallocate matrix to contain all companies in a community and its power
  m <- matrix(nrow = length(V(community)), ncol = 2)
  # set column names
  colnames(m) <- c("Company_ID", "Power")
  # fill columns by using vertex attributes
  m[, "Company_ID"] <- get.vertex.attribute(community, "name")
  m[, "Power"] <- get.vertex.attribute(community, "power")
  # return matrix with calculated power for each company
  return(m)
}

# loop through all communities created by the clustering function
for (c in 1:length(communities)) {
  # define variable name dynamically by including community index
  community.x <- paste("community", c, sep = "_")
  # create a subgraph for each community and assign it to the variable
  assign(
    community.x,
    induced_subgraph(g, v = communities[[c]])
  )
  
  # calculate powers for each company in their respective community
  # force R to evaluate the dynamic variable with eval(parse),
  # else it's evaluated as a character string
  power <- calculate.power(community = eval(parse(text=community.x)))
  print(paste('Power values in community', c, ':'))
  # print matrix to console
  print(power)
  # print sum of powers of each company in the community
  print(paste0('SUM(Powers) = ', sum(as.numeric(power[, "Power"]))))
  cat('\n')
  
  # write the matrix to a csv file
  write.table(power, file = paste0(community.x, '.csv'), row.names = FALSE, col.names = TRUE, sep = ";")
}

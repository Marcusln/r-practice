## Problem 4

Letâ€™s imagine a long hotel corridor with 100 doors all in a row. All
doors are numbered 1 to 100 (in order). All doors are initially opened.
We send 10 persons, one after another, to change the state of the
doors:<br /> to close the door (if it is opened) OR to open the door (if
it is closed)

<pre>
The first person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 5-th door: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100
The second person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 10-th door: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60,70, 80, 90, 100
The third person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 15-th door: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90
The fourth person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 20-th door: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100
The fifth person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 25-th door: 25, 50, 75, 100
The sixth person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 30-th door: 30, 60, 90
The seventh person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 35-th door: 35, 70
The eighth person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 40-th door: 40, 80
The ninth person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 45-th door: 45, 90
The tenth person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 50-th door: 50, 100
</pre>

You should write an R-code that will output the numbers of doors that
are closed after all 10 persons went through the given hotel corridor.

NOTE: your R-code should not output the total number of closed doors. It
should output the specific numbers of doors that are closed after all 10
persons went through the given hotel corridor.

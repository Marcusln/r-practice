## Problem 3

Write an R code that takes a temperature in any of the following
degrees: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin; and displays an equivalent
temperature in any of the following degrees: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and
Kelvin.

Your solution code should contain at least four functions. One of the
functions should have the following format:

`conversion(temp, from, to)`, where:

1.  Argument `temp` takes a temperature (any numeric value) to process.

2.  Argument `from` specifies the temperature scale of the temperature
    value `temp`. Specifically, argument `from` takes one of the
    following character-mode values:<br /><br /> “C” – corresponds to
    Celsius;  
    “F” – corresponds to Fahrenheit;  
    “K” – corresponds to Kelvin.

3.  Argument `to` specifies the temperature scale of the resulting
    temperature value that should be returned by the `conversion`
    function. Argument `to` takes one of the following character-mode
    values:<br /><br />“C” – corresponds to Celsius;  
    “F” – corresponds to Fahrenheit;  
    “K” – corresponds to Kelvin.

Thus, arguments `from` and `to` can take any of the following values:
“C”, “F”, “K”. Function `conversion` takes a value of `temp` in a
temperature scale of `from` and returns the corresponding value in a
temperature scale of `to`.

For example, function `conversion(-41.5,"K","F")` takes -41.5 degrees on
the Kelvin scale and returns -534.37 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale.

Your code should display “ERROR”-message if parameters `from` and/or
`to` take any character-mode value other than “C”, “F”, or “K”.

For example, when the function `conversion(-41.5,"D","F")` is called it
should return the following value in the R console:  
`[1] "ERROR"`

``` r
convert.to.fahrenheit <- function(from, temp) {
  if (from == "C") {
    temp * (9/5) + 32
  } else if (from == "K") {
    (temp * 1.8) - 459.67
  }
}

convert.to.celsius <- function(from, temp) {
  if (from == "K") {
    temp - 273.15
  } else if (from == "F") {
    (temp - 32) / 1.8
  }
}

convert.to.kelvin <- function(from, temp) {
  if (from == "K") {
    temp + 273.15
  } else if (from == "F") {
    (temp + 459.67) / 1.8 
  }
}

conversion <- function(temp, from, to) {
  valid.scales <- c("C", "F", "K")
  if (!from %in% valid.scales || !to %in% valid.scales) stop('ERROR')
  if (from == to) return(temp)
  
  switch(to,
    "C" = convert.to.celsius(from, temp),
    "K" = convert.to.kelvin(from, temp),
    "F" = convert.to.fahrenheit(from, temp)
  )
}
```

### Test the code

``` r
conversion(13.5, "K", "C")
```

    ## [1] -259.65

``` r
conversion(-30, "C", "F")
```

    ## [1] -22

``` r
conversion(20, "C", "C")
```

    ## [1] 20

``` r
conversion(-0.5, "H", "K")
```

    ## Error in conversion(-0.5, "H", "K"): ERROR

## Problem 4

Let’s imagine a long hotel corridor with 100 doors all in a row. All
doors are numbered 1 to 100 (in order). All doors are initially opened.
We send 10 persons, one after another, to change the state of the
doors:<br /> to close the door (if it is opened) OR to open the door (if
it is closed)

<pre>
The first person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 5-th door: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100
The second person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 10-th door: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60,70, 80, 90, 100
The third person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 15-th door: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90
The fourth person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 20-th door: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100
The fifth person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 25-th door: 25, 50, 75, 100
The sixth person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 30-th door: 30, 60, 90
The seventh person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 35-th door: 35, 70
The eighth person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 40-th door: 40, 80
The ninth person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 45-th door: 45, 90
The tenth person sent to the corridor has to change the state of every 50-th door: 50, 100
</pre>

You should write an R-code that will output the numbers of doors that
are closed after all 10 persons went through the given hotel corridor.

NOTE: your R-code should not output the total number of closed doors. It
should output the specific numbers of doors that are closed after all 10
persons went through the given hotel corridor.

``` r
doors <- c(rep("open", 100))

for (person in 1:10) {
  intervall <- seq(0, 100, by = person * 5)
  doors[intervall] <- ifelse(doors[intervall] == "open", "closed", "open")
}

which(doors == "closed")
```

    ##  [1]   5  20  45  55  60  65  70  75  85  90  95 100
